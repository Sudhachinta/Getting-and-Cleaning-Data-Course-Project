The original data set used for this project is:

More detailed description of the data is here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The expected result is to create a tidy independent data set from the data above with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook.md contains the description of variables, data and the transformations made to the original dataset -
